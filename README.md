# todo-CLI

My first Java project in preperation for another project where I won't be writing a ton of java personally, but I want to be able to understand a little but about what the java devs are doing.

This is a basic todo list that uses a linked list and the CLI and the GUI.

to run clone the repo and use `javac *.java` then `java main` in the directory.
